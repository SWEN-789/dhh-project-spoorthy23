Welcome to my ASR project
To check it out follow the steps below:
1.) Open the "index.html" file in a web browser (preferably Chrome)
2.) Now click on the Microphone button available on the page
3.) Once you click on it, you'll get an alert message requesting permission to access your microphone along with a chime sound
4.) Once you access the permission, start talking and see the words you are saying appear magically on the screen in the textbox.
